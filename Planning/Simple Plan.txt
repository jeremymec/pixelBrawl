2D platform fighting game.

Two players, both play on the same machine locally.
This means two player objects running at the same time.
Different Inputs, so input must be variable.
Could achieve this by passing in values, or through static data in a prefab.

Players have lives / HP bar. Game is won when a player's HP reachs zero.

Move and jump between platform objects. Cast spells and attack other players.

Maps have platforms and can be stored in a unity scene which is loaded by base.

BASE
-----
GAME - Needs to store information about current stage of game, if game won,
tell scene to load level, start / quit game

SCENE - Needs to load a scene

PLAYER - EACH player needs to store HP, movement (must be different), and if
different playable characters needs to handle what type of player they are

CAMERA - Needs to move according to positon in scene

ATTACKS - Created by player, maybe created in the player class?
