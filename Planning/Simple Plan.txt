2D platform fighting game.

Two players, both play on the same machine locally.
This means two player objects running at the same time.
Different Inputs, so input must be variable.
Could achieve this by passing in values, or through static data in a prefab.

Players have lives / HP bar. Game is won when a player's HP reachs zero.

Move and jump between platform objects. Cast spells and attack other players.

Maps have platforms and can be stored in a unity scene which is loaded by base.
